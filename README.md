Welcome to NETstats.
NETstats is a simple batch script that uses information from the "netstat" command in windows to get information about the connections established to your machine.
You can run it without administrator permissions, since it doesn't require it, and you won't be loosing any functionality whatsoever.
As always, the project will remain open source and everyone is allowed to use my code!

**Important!** NETstats development has been temporarily halted since I have no motivation to continue developing it (at the time of speaking).
Don't expect the project to 100% continue being developed in the future because I wanna take a break and focus on more important things, including my personal life and school.

Thanks for understanding
