Welcome to NETstats.
NETstats is a simple batch script that uses information from the "netstat" command in windows to get information about the connections established to your machine.
You can run it without administrator permissions, since it doesn't require it, and you won't be loosing any functionality whatsoever.
As always, the project will remain open source and everyone is allowed to use my code!
